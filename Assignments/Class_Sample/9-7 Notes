Copy the 3 links in "Handouts/class examples" directory      <- Will have .h files and libraries that we need
Create a master directory for this class and each program gets its own sub directory
copy the "Makefile" into each new directory
  within that Makefile we just copied and change GEN_EXE = 'name of new progarm (directory)'
  Create a .c file for the program - (usually by copying an existing program)
  Name the .c file the same as the directory its in
If you have the "Makefile" in that directory you should be able to compile with just 'make' command


main(int argc, char *argv[]){
  if(argc != 2){
    usageErr("%s <file name> \n)", argv[0]);
  }

  int fd, cc;
  fd = open(argv[1], O_WRONLY);

  if(fd == -1){
    errMsg(" for open on file %s.\n", argv[1];
  }
  else {
    fprintf(stderr, "Successfully opened file %s.\n", argv[1]);
  }
  cc = close(fd);
  if(cc == -1){
    errExit(" for close on file descriptor %d.\n", fd);
  }
  else {
    fprintf(stderr, "Successfully closed file with file descriptor %d.\n", fd);
  }
}
